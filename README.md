# **Automotive Market Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard**  

## **Tech Stack**  
**Tool:** Excel  

## **About**  
The dataset provided relates to the automotive industry. A potential problem to investigate is:  
*"How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?"*  
Understanding these factors is crucial for car manufacturers to remain competitive, align with market trends, and improve profitability.  

## **Description**  
The project involves the following steps:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, and feature engineering.  
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different variables such as engine power, fuel efficiency, price, and market category.  
- **Regression & Segmentation**: Identifying key factors that influence car prices and consumer preferences.  
- **Report & Data Storytelling**: Presenting findings through visualizations and insights to support strategic decision-making.

## **Data Analytics Tasks**  

### **A) Market Category Popularity**  
**Task:** Analyze the distribution of car models across market categories and their popularity.  
- Determine the number of car models in each market category.  
- Assess popularity scores for different categories.  
- Visualize the relationship between market category and popularity using a combo chart.  

**Hint:** Use Pivot Tables to count models by category and calculate average popularity. Use a Combo Chart for visualization.

### **B) Engine Power vs. Price Relationship**  
**Task:** Analyze the correlation between a car's engine power and its price.  
- Create a scatter plot with engine power on the x-axis and price on the y-axis.  
- Add a trendline to visualize the relationship.  

**Hint:** Use Excel's **CORREL** function to measure the strength of the relationship and add a **trendline** for better interpretation.

### **C) Key Features Affecting Price**  
**Task:** Identify the most important car features influencing price.  
- Use regression analysis to determine the strongest variables affecting price.  
- Create a bar chart displaying coefficient values of key features.  

**Hint:** Use Excel's **Regression Tool (Data Analysis Add-in)** to derive coefficients and visualize them using a **bar chart**.  

---

### **D) Manufacturer Pricing Trends**  
**Task:** Analyze how the average price of a car varies across manufacturers.  
- Create a pivot table showing the average car price per manufacturer.  
- Generate a bar chart comparing manufacturer pricing trends.  

**Hint:** Use Pivot Tables and **AVERAGEIF** functions to compute prices and visualize them using a **stacked or clustered bar chart**.  

---

### **E) Fuel Efficiency vs. Cylinders**  
**Task:** Analyze the relationship between the number of cylinders in a car and its highway MPG (fuel efficiency).  
- Create a scatter plot with cylinders on the x-axis and highway MPG on the y-axis.  
- Add a trendline to assess the relationship.  
- Calculate the correlation coefficient to quantify the strength of the relationship.  

**Hint:** Use **CORREL** and **TRENDLINE** features in Excel for visualization and analysis.

## **Interactive Dashboard Development**  

### **1. Price Distribution by Brand & Body Style**  
- **Visualization:** Stacked column chart.  
- **Insight:** Luxury brands have higher price concentrations, while economy brands display a more uniform distribution across body styles.  

### **2. MSRP Comparison by Brand & Body Style**  
- **Visualization:** Clustered column chart.  
- **Insight:** Premium brands show varied price fluctuations across body styles, while budget brands maintain steady pricing.  

### **3. Transmission Type Impact on MSRP**  
- **Visualization:** Scatter plot (different symbols for body styles).  
- **Insight:** Automatic transmissions typically have higher prices, particularly in sedans and SUVs.  

### **4. Fuel Efficiency Trends by Model Year**  
- **Visualization:** Line chart.  
- **Insight:** The rise of hybrid and electric technology has steadily improved fuel efficiency across model years.  

### **5. Horsepower, MPG, and Price by Brand**  
- **Visualization:** Bubble chart.  
- **Insight:** High-performance brands prioritize horsepower over fuel efficiency, whereas economy brands focus on affordability and efficiency.  

---

## **Insights On**  
- **Market Trends:** SUVs and sedans remain dominant, while luxury brands maintain exclusivity.  
- **Price Determinants:** Engine power, brand reputation, and advanced features significantly impact pricing.  
- **Fuel Efficiency:** More cylinders generally reduce MPG, but hybrid/turbocharged engines improve efficiency.  
- **Manufacturer Strategies:** Premium brands focus on value-based pricing, while economy brands emphasize affordability and efficiency.
